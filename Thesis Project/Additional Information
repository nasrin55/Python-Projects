This is a deep learning model using CNN to classify handwritten English alphabets (a-z, A–Z) and digits (0–9).
Utilized Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, OpenCV, Keras, and TensorFlow.
Collected two Kaggle datasets (.csv) for alphabets and numbers, then cleaned, merged, and prepared them for training.
Trained the model on a large set of 2D image samples and performed class distribution analysis.
Implemented user input recognition with real-time prediction feedback.
Generated a confusion matrix to evaluate performance and improve model reliability.
Achieved an outstanding recognition accuracy of around 99%.
